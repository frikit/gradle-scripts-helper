# gradle-scripts-helper
Intent of this project is to keep all my shell/batch related scripts in one place to use them in any project
I'm working on, keep things easier for me.

Current intention was only for scripts shell/batch but maybe will be better to add also gradle groovy/kotlin 
tasks/methods, which help to solve a specific piece of problem


# Contribution
You can contribute with your scripts, but we need to keep document each script to help other to find these scripts easier
also comment as many lines of script code as you can
